# Genesis
*A private, offline shopping list app built for simplicity and speed.*

**Genesis** is an offline-first shopping list manager built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Vite**.  
It leverages **Dexie.js** for IndexedDB storage, enabling smooth offline usage and data persistence.  
With Genesis, users can create and manage multiple customizable shopping lists that work entirely on the client-side â€” no backend required.

## Features

- **Fully offline support:** Store data locally with Dexie.js and use PWA caching to ensure the app works without an internet connection.  
- **Customizable lists:** Create, edit, and organize multiple shopping lists to suit different needs and occasions.  
- **Data export:** Export or download shopping lists as files for easy sharing and backup.  
- **Client-side only:** Everything runs in the browser (no server or backend needed).
